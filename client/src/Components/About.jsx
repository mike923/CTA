            This app was made in part to assess my technical abilities. I am part of a year-long bootcampstyled program designed to turn me into a Full Stack Web Developer. As a part of this program we were assigned a task in which we are to create a TV database app in which we implement reactjs, nodejs, postgresql, and other programming languages to make this app fully functional.
